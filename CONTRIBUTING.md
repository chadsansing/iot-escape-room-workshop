# How to contribute

You don't need technical skills to contribute to this repo or to use it to facilitate an IoT Escape Room workshop for your community.

There are many ways to contribute both here and on the [Google Docs version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RfXgqHbLDygJ-ldJYfHEM76rAXc6rZ7b) of this project.

- You can file issues on GitHub (or make comments on the Google Docs) to suggest improvements and ask questions about this workshop model.
- You can email project lead [Chad Sansing](mailto:chad@mozillafoundation.org) with feedback.
- You can create your own paper prototype puzzles and share them with us by linking to them in an issue, or by emailing Chad to share.
- You can run your own local version of this workshop, document it, and share an event report back to us with lessons learned and suggestions for improving or localizing our model.
- You can localize this repo or the Google Docs version of these materials into a different language and share a link to that work with us so we can help you let people know about your version.
- Suggest new design deck cards by filing an issue, making a comment, or emailing Chad.

If you have more experience with GitHub or more technical experience you can also

- Fork this repo, make suggested changes, and ship a pull request (PR) back to Chad.
- For this repo, add your own materials and designs for prototype devices and puzzles, and ship a PR back to Chad.
- Create online IoT Escape Room puzzles to share with anyone interested in this work and send us the links so we can help people find your work.

Your participation in this project and contributions to it are not limited to these suggestions. We'd love to help you understand and implement this kind of workshop however we can. Thanks!
