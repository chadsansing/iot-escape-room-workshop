# iot-escape-room-workshop

Project lead: [Chad Sansing](mailto:chad@mozillafoundation.org)

## Background

At Mozilla, we believe in participatory learning, and this IoT Escape Room workshop model gives us the chance to unpack [Internet health](https://internethealthreport.org/) issues associated with connected devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) — like [Privacy & Security](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/privacy-security/) — in fun, social, and collaborative ways.

By building and documenting an escape room prototype with activists, educators, and librarians, we hope to create a kit that our participants and their organizations can use, share, adapt, and replicate to teach their communities about the opportunities connected devices bring to our daily lives and the challenges they present to our individual and collective privacy and security.

Working within the framework of our Open Leadership Map (now in public beta), we’ve worked to design and build an event that will empower participants to:

- Understand the Internet health issues presented by connected devices and why we’ve approached them this way.
- Share innovative, fun resources for teaching Internet health and the methods we used to develop them.
- Invite and include participants from their communities to co-create similar projects

In terms of community interactions, we’re focused on:

- Creating together: We want participants to build their own IoT Escape Room.
- Soliciting ideas: We want prototypes to come from participants’ suggestions, not ours.
- Learning through use: We want participants’ direct feedback on the workshop so we can improve it, document it, and share it.
- Enhancing value exchange: We want workshop participants to finish with a kit they can inexpensively share and replicate.
- Networking common interests: We want to activists, educators, and librarians interested in IoT to attend and then spread this work after the event.

Workshop topics include:

- Community participation guidelines.
- How the Internet works.
- How Gigabit networks work.
- How connected devices and IoT work.
- What kinds of interactions you can have with connected devices.
- How the design process works.
- Prototyping puzzles, stories, and documentation for an IoT Escape Room.

We work intentionally to recruit facilitators from diverse backgrounds and with a veriaty of expertise. For example, for our first workshop, facilitators will join us from:

- Mozilla's Communications team.
- Mozilla's Gigabit team.
- Mozilla's NSF WINS challenge team.
- Mozilla's Open IoT Studio team.
- Mozilla's Open Leadership & Events team.
- The Chattanooga Gigabit Fund community.
- Our network’s design community.
- Our network’s open data community.

At the end of this 2-day workshop, we’ll open the workshop to the public for a celebratory demo or gallery walk of everything participants have built.

If any of this sounds good to you, please let us know how to help you take next steps! We would love to be of servive.

## How to use this repo

This repo is meant to provide methods and examples to use in facilitasting your own IoT Escape Room workshop.

It's our hope that you can use the activities, methods, and materials described in this repo to facilitate your own version of an IoT Escape Room workshop in your community.

There are 4 major components to the repo:

1. Day 1
2. Day 2
3. Materials
4. Examples

### Day 1

Day 1 includes several leveling activities meant to establish common background knowledge amongst participants about

- The Internet.
- Gigabit networks.
- Online privacy & security issues.
- The Internet of Things and connected devices.
- Design.
- The IoT Escape Room challenge itself.

Day 1 also includes a method for choosing a theme and audience for the work by consensus.

### Day 2

Day 2 is meant to be a more open, emergent, and sprint-like experience as participants document their work, create a story for their escape room, and build the protoypes they want to use to get people asking questions about privacy & security.

We've included the methods we use to help participants form working groups and communicate with one another to develop the story, prototypes, and documentation they need to build and share an IoT escape room with their communities in places like librariers, schools, and community centers.

### Materials

Special printables and materials are available inside the repo's "materials" folder. You should source generic supplies like craft materials, sticky notes, and tape from wherever you normally do.

### Examples

We've invited participants to share artifacts from their work at past workshops with us and the broader IoT Escape Room community. In this folder you'll find photos, snippets of code, and other pieces of documentation meant to inspire prototypes in future workshops.
